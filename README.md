A fork of Bootstrap 3.3.1 minus the JavaScript.

All CVE's against bootstrap 3.3.1 are because of the JavaScript and dependency on jQuery. White-green-red does not use JavaScript or jQuery. It is just css.

The few bootstrap components that require JavaScript are not available in white-green-red.

The bootstrap fonts have been remove as well.
